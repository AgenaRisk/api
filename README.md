# AgenaRisk 10 API
Public AgenaRisk 10 API is a project that aims to make API programming with AgenaRisk easy.
AgenaRisk Java API v2 is ultimately a convenient front-end for the AgenaRisk Core engine and puts the focus on:
- providing shortcuts for operations that previously used to be extremely complicated
- abstracting low level core data structures
- hiding most of the core functionality that was not self-explanatory or unsafe
- fully documented features
